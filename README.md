# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Pipeline
In this project, we build a supervised learning pipeline to classify political tweets based on their author. The dataset consists of labeled tweets from political figures and organizations, and the goal is to predict whether a tweet belongs to a conservative (e.g., `realDonaldTrump`, `GOP`) or liberal (e.g., `JoeBiden`, `TheDemocrats`) source.

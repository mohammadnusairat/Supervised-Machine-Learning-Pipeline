    "_According to the **Academic Integrity Policy** of this course, all work submitted for grading must be done individually, unless otherwise specified. While we encourage you to talk to your peers and learn from them, this interaction must be superficial with regards to all work submitted for grading. This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, you cannot submit someone else’s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance. Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums. Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying-pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you.  **Note that using AI-generated code (Google Gemini, ChatGPT, copilot, etc) verbatim in your submission also comes under academic dishonesty, as discussed in the first lecture. You may solicit help from Generative AI tools to assist you in the assignment, but not to do the assignment for you**. **Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, and penalties range from failure to expulsion from the university; cases are handled via the official student conduct process described at https://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml**._ \n",

    "This homework is an individual assignment for all graduate students. Undergraduate students are allowed to work in pairs and submit one homework assignment per pair. There will be no extra credit given to undergraduate students who choose to work alone. The pairs of students who choose to work together and submit one homework assignment together still need to abide by the Academic Integrity Policy and not share or receive help from others (except each other).\n",

    "## Due Date\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is due at **11:59 PM, October 28, 2024**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Submit\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to complete all code and answer all questions denoted by **Q#** in this notebook. When you are done, you should export **`hw3.ipynb`** with your answers as a PDF file, upload that file `hw3.pdf` to *Homework 3 - Written Part* on Gradescope, **tagging each question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to copy all functions that are part of questions Q1-Q9 to `hw3.py`. That includes `process()`, `process_all()`, `create_features()`, `create_labels()`, `class MajorityLabelClassifier()`, `learn_classifier()`, `evaluate_classifier()`, `best_model_selection()` and `classify_tweets()`. You need to upload a completed Jupyter notebook (`hw3.ipynb` file) and `hw3.py` to *Homework 3 - code* on Gradescope. To help you get started, we have provided a template file (`hw3_template.py`) containing imports, some hints, and function skeletons.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For undergraduate students who work in a team of two, only one student needs to submit the homework and just tag the other student on Gradescope.\n",

    "#### Autograding\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions will be graded based on both manual grading and an Autograder which will run on your `hw3.py` file.\n",
    "This assignment is graded on the basis of correctness and 80/100 points are given by the autograder. The remaining 20 points will be manually graded (10 points for Q8, 2 points for Q9 and 8 points for correctly running everything in the Jupyter notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the questions are graded independently. This means that if you have an error in a question, it will not be propagated to another question. However, the final question Q9 will check your overall pipeline and is rather expensive to run on Gradescope. Therefore, you should disable its auto-grading on Gradescope until you have implemented and passed Q1 to Q7. A function `test_pipeline()` is provided in the hw3_template.py file that returns `False` by default to disable auto-grading of Q9. Once you complete the implementation of Q1 to Q7, you can enable auto-grading of the whole pipeline by setting `test_pipeline()` to return `True`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cases will take a bit longer to execute. Make use of the resources wisely by first testing your functions in your notebook or making local test cases."

    "# Classifying tweets [100%]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will be analyzing Twitter data related to the 2016 US Presidential election extracted using [the Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api). The data contains tweets posted by the following six Twitter accounts: `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP, HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats`\n",
    "\n",
    "For every tweet, there are two pieces of information:\n",
    "- `screen_name`: the Twitter handle of the user tweeting and\n",
    "- `text`: the content of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweets have been divided into two parts - train and test available to you in CSV files. For train, both the `screen_name` and `text` attributes were provided but for test, `screen_name` is hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal of the problem is to \"predict\" the political inclination (Republican/Democratic) of the Twitter user from one of his/her tweets. The ground truth (i.e., true class labels) is determined from the `screen_name` of the tweet as follows\n",
    "- `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP` are Republicans\n",
    "- `HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats` are Democrats\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this is a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem proceeds in three stages:\n",
    "- **Text processing (25%)**: We will clean up the raw tweet text using the various functions offered by the [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/genindex.html) package.\n",
    "- **Feature construction (25%)**: In this part, we will construct bag-of-words feature vectors and training labels from the processed text of tweets and the `screen_name` columns respectively.\n",
    "- **Classification (50%)**: Using the features derived, we will use [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) package to learn a model which classifies the tweets as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use two new python packages in this problem: `nltk` and `sklearn`, both of which should be available in Anaconda and Google Colab. However, NLTK comes with many corpora, toy grammars, trained models, etc, which have to be downloaded manually. This assignment requires NLTK's stopwords list, POS tagger, and WordNetLemmatizer.

    "1. The tokens must all be in lower case.\n",
    "2. The tokens should appear in the same order as in the raw text.\n",
    "3. The tokens must be in their lemmatized form. If a word cannot be lemmatized (i.e, you get an exception), simply catch it and ignore it. These words will not appear in the token list.\n",
    "4. The tokens must not contain any punctuations. Punctuations should be handled as follows: (a) Apostrophe of the form `'s` must be ignored. e.g., `She's` becomes `she`. (b) Other apostrophes should be omitted. e.g, `don't` becomes `dont`. (c) Words must be broken at the hyphen and other punctuations.\n",
    "5. The tokens must not contain any part of a url.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of your work is to figure out a logical order to carry out the above operations. You may find `string.punctuation` useful, to get hold of all punctuation symbols. Look for [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) capturing urls in the text. Your tokens must be of type `str`. Use `nltk.word_tokenize()` for tokenization once you have handled punctuation in the manner specified above.\n",

    "You would want to take a look at the `lemmatize()` function [here](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.html).\n",
    "In order for `lemmatize()` to give you the root form for any word, you have to provide the context in which you want to lemmatize through the `pos` parameter: `lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos=SOMEVALUE)`. The context should be the part of speech (POS) for that word. The good news is you do not have to manually write out the lexical categories for each word because [nltk.pos_tag()](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html) will do this for you. Now you just need to use the results from `pos_tag()` for the `pos` parameter.\n",

    "The next step is to derive feature vectors from the tokenized tweets. In this section, you will be constructing a bag-of-words TF-IDF feature vector. But before that, as you may have guessed, the number of possible words is prohibitively large and not all of them may be useful for our classification task. We need to determine which words to retain, and which to omit. A common heuristic is to construct a frequency distribution of words in the corpus and prune out the head and tail of the distribution. The intuition of the above operation is as follows. Very common words (i.e. stopwords) add almost no information regarding similarity of two pieces of text. Similarly with very rare words. NLTK has a list of in-built stop words which is a good substitute for head of the distribution. We will consider a word rare if it occurs only in a single document (row) in whole of `tweets_train.csv`.\n",

You need to pass a parameter `min_df=2` to filter out the words occuring only in one document in the whole training set. Remember to ignore the stop words as well. You must leave other optional parameters (e.g., `vocab`, `norm`, etc) at their default values. But you may need to use parameters like `lowercase` and `tokenizer` to handle `processed_tweets` that is a `list` of tokens (not raw text)."

    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to learn a classifier, the next step is to evaluate it, ie., characterize how good its classification performance is. This step is necessary to select the best model among a given set of models, or even tune hyperparameters for a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two questions that should now come to your mind:\n",
    "1. **What data to use?**\n",
    "    - **Validation Data**: The data used to evaluate a classifier is called **validation data** (or hold-out data), and it is usually different from the data used for training. The model or hyperparameter with the best performance in the held out data is chosen. This approach is relatively fast and simple but vulnerable to biases found in validation set.\n",
    "    - **Cross-validation**: This approach divides the dataset in $k$ groups (so, called k-fold cross-validation). One of group is used as test set for evaluation and other groups as training set. The model or hyperparameter with the best average performance across all k folds is chosen. For this question you will perform 4-fold cross validation to determine the best kernel. We will keep all other hyperparameters default for now. This approach provides robustness toward biasness in validation set. However, it takes more time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **And what metric?** There are several evaluation measures available in the literature (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F-1,etc) and different fields have different preferences for specific metrics due to different goals. We will go with accuracy. According to wiki, **accuracy** of a classifier measures the fraction of all data points that are correctly classified by it; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of (correct and incorrect) classifications. `sklearn.metrics` provides a number of performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, implement the following function."

    "Now it is time to decide which kernel works best by using the cross-validation technique. Write code to split the training data into 4-folds (75% training and 25% validation) by shuffling randomly. For each kernel, record the average accuracy for all folds and determine the best classifier. Since our dataset is balanced (both classes are in almost equal propertion), `sklearn.model_selection.KFold` [doc](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) can be used for cross-validation."
